Hi there! I'm Shayan. ðŸ‘‹  
Iâ€™m a full-stack developer, problem solver, and curious tinkerer.  
I build high-performance web apps, wire up reliable backends, and keep things elegant and maintainable.

Outside the editor youâ€™ll catch me tuning my dev setup, lifting, reading about the future of computing,  
and dreaming up side-projects I may or may not finish ðŸ˜…
