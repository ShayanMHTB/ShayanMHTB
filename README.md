Hi there! 👋  
I’m Shayan — a full-stack developer with over 5 years of experience building everything from clean, responsive frontends to scalable, fault-tolerant backends.

**Technologies I work with:**

- **Backend:** Java (Spring Boot), Python (Django), JavaScript/TypeScript (NestJS), and more
- **Frontend:** React, Angular, Vue
- **Databases:** MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB
- **Communication:** REST API, GraphQL

**Fields I’m exploring & passionate about:**  
AI, Machine Learning, Neural Networks, Web3, Quantum Computing, IoT, and pretty much anything that pushes the limits of technology.

I’m a curious problem solver who loves clean architecture, elegant code, and tackling challenges head-on.  
When I’m not coding, you’ll probably find me at the gym, reading about emerging tech, or diving into side projects that sometimes spiral into full-blown products.

Fun facts:

- I can debug faster with music in the background
- I like building things just to see if they work
- “Quick fixes” often turn into weekend-long coding sessions
